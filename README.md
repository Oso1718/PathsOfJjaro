Paths Of Jjaro
=======
Paths of Jjaro is a 3D game based on Bungie's Marathon, made by the community for the community. Open sourced.
Made with Godot. The code itself is under MIT License. 

As the game assets are based on the original assets, we must include for licensing information a modified version of the one AlephOne used to need for the Marathon data.

## How the project is structured

In the previous version of the game, the codebase was Joyeuse, which was scrapped in favor of a new modular approach. 
Currently, only code and barebones assets are present in the repo, as the game is still in development, and any other asset will only be distributed once a release is made.








# Marathon game content non-license

Unfortunately, Bungie has not released Marathon game content under a formal, unambiguous content license. To our knowledge, Bungie has not blocked any noncommercial distribution of these assets, but the Marathon series is not considered abandonware and Bungie retains the right to control its distribution and use.


## History

In 2000, Bungie released the Marathon 2 source code under the GPL 2 license, which led to the Aleph One project. The game content was not part of this release; the games were still commercially available at the time.

In 2005, Bungie made the Marathon game content freely available, at [trilogyrelease.bungie.org][1]. No content license was posted. The Frequently Asked Questions page includes this statement:

> **Wow... can I do whatever I want with this stuff?**

> NO. Bungie still holds the copyrights to these files. They're allowing them to be distributed for free (mostly because you can't buy them any more) - but they're still Bungie's intellectual property. You can't, for example, sell them.

In 2011, Bungie released the [Marathon Infinity source code][2] under the GPL 3 license. The source code archive also included a CC-BY-NC-SA 3.0 license, but its scope is unclear. It may only cover the design documents and other non-code files present alongside the source, and not the game data (which was not part of the archive).

In late 2011, Aleph One began distributing Marathon game content bundled with Aleph One binaries, in the spirit of the Trilogy Release page's "free distribution" aim. Bungie [announced these bundled downloads][3] on their company site, so Bungie was aware of and tacitly approved Aleph One's redistribution of the game content.
